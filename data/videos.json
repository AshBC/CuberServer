    "description": "Frewuhn’s Freedom Summer Mixtape Temple is an immersive digital gallery showcasing archival mixed media works created during the artist’s CAMHLAB (Contemporary Art Museum Houston) residency. This virtual space features in-depth artist interviews, panel discussions, recorded performances, and sound installations designed for viewers to experience inside the ONE / OFF Black Arts District on Cryptovoxels. Explore the Temple and meet with Frewuhn to ask questions about her work, process, and residency at CAMH. These panel discussions which can be watched through embedded Youtube's, pose the question, how do we define protest? And how can these definitions be reimagined for the future?  Follow CAMH’s Instagram (@camhouston) for more information about Frewuhn’s work with the future of protest and how to engage with this digital world.",
