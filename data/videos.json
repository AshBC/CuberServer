    "description": "It seems like a joke, but there’s a deeper meaning to these salacious pictures; some men in crypto want to make sure the emerging non-fungible token space doesn’t become as misogynistic as the legacy mediums it’s coming to replace. It all started with a CoinDesk article, published back in September, about how women in crypto are leveraging “thirst trap” NFTs to take ownership of their public image. The article posits that women can use these tools to choose how they want to present themselves to the world, and profit from it. Men have been able to sexualize women or demean them for their appearance; now crypto offers a way for women to take control and benefit from their sex appeal with NFT thirst traps. But to be clear, a thirst trap is a picture taken with the intent to sexually entice people. However Words matter, and so do connotations. “Thirst trap” is a loaded term that implies a person is intentionally taking sexualized pictures. Writing about how someone is selling thirst trap pictures for thousands of dollars and comparing them to a famous sex worker paints a very different picture than writing about how someone is playing around with turning selfies into NFTs.",

    "description": "Frewuhn’s Freedom Summer Mixtape Temple is an immersive digital gallery showcasing archival mixed media works created during the artist’s CAMHLAB (Contemporary Art Museum Houston) residency. This virtual space features in-depth artist interviews, panel discussions, recorded performances, and sound installations designed for viewers to experience inside the ONE / OFF Black Arts District on Cryptovoxels. Explore the Temple and meet with Frewuhn to ask questions about her work, process, and residency at CAMH. These panel discussions which can be watched through embedded Youtube's, pose the question, how do we define protest? And how can these definitions be reimagined for the future?  Follow CAMH’s Instagram (@camhouston) for more information about Frewuhn’s work with the future of protest and how to engage with this digital world.",
